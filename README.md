# Humanoid Navigation

Humanoid Navigation - A reinforcement learning project for training humanoid robots to walk, stand, and navigate using MuJoCo physics simulation.

## Overview

This project focuses on developing AI agents that can control humanoid robots to perform various locomotion tasks:

- Walking: Learning stable bipedal locomotion
- Standing: Maintaining balance and posture  
- Navigation: Moving towards goals while avoiding obstacles

## Features

- Physics-based simulation using MuJoCo
- Reinforcement learning training pipeline
- Multiple locomotion behaviors (walking, standing, navigation)
- Configurable training environments
- Real-time visualization and monitoring
- Performance metrics and evaluation tools
