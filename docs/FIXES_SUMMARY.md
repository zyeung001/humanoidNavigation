## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Reward Function Redesign (`src/environments/standing_env.py`)

#### Problems Identified:
- **Negative total rewards**: Agent received negative rewards even when standing well
- **Conflicting objectives**: Velocity penalty punished necessary balancing movements
- **Exponential scaling issues**: Reward dropped to near-zero too quickly (10cm error ≈ 0 reward)
- **Wrong target height**: 1.3m instead of correct 1.4m for Humanoid-v5

#### Solutions Implemented:
```python
# NEW REWARD STRUCTURE (lines 97-211):
# - Base standing reward: +10 points/step (always positive baseline)
# - Height reward: 0-50 points (gentler exponential: exp(-5.0) instead of exp(-12.0))
# - Upright reward: 0-20 points
# - Stability reward: 0-10 points (rewards LOW angular momentum, not zero velocity)
# - Smoothness reward: 0-5 points (smooth joint movements)
# - Control cost: -5 to 0 (small penalty, not dominant)
# - Sustained bonus: +100 every 50 steps (sparse reward for consistency)
#
# TOTAL: 10-100 points/step (typical: 50-85 for good standing)
```

**Expected Reward Ranges:**
- Perfect standing: 80-100 points/step
- Good standing (small errors): 50-80 points/step
- Poor standing: 10-30 points/step
- Falling: 0-10 points/step

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Rewards are **predominantly positive** (base +10 always)
- ✅ Removed velocity penalty conflict (balance requires movement!)
- ✅ Gentler exponential scaling (5cm error still gives ~40 points)
- ✅ Correct target height: **1.4m** (was 1.3m)

### 2. ✅ Observation Space Fix (`src/environments/standing_env.py`)

#### Problem:
- MDP observability violation: reward penalized XY position drift, but agent couldn't observe position

#### Solution:
```python
# Line 32: Changed from True to False
exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False  # CRITICAL FIX
```

**Result:** Agent can now observe its position and learn to correct for drift.

---

### 3. ✅ Improved Termination Conditions (`src/environments/standing_env.py`)

#### Problem:
- Too lenient termination (height < 0.6m, quat[0] < 0.3)
- Agent could flail in bad states for thousands of steps

#### Solution:
```python
# Lines 189-193: More reasonable thresholds
terminate = (
    height < 0.8 or          # Was 0.6m (too lenient)
    height > 2.0 or          
    abs(quat[0]) < 0.7       # Was 0.3 (torso angle > 45°)
)
```

**Result:** Training focuses on recoverable states, not hopeless flailing.

---

### 4. ✅ Optimized Hyperparameters (`config/training_config.yaml`)

#### Problems:
- Learning rate too low (0.0003)
- Network too small ([128, 128] for 17 DOF humanoid)
- Entropy coefficient too low (0.01, limiting exploration)
- Batch size mismatch (512 doesn't divide 16,384 evenly)
- Total timesteps insufficient (500k)

#### Solutions:
```yaml
# OPTIMIZED HYPERPARAMETERS:
total_timesteps: 2000000        # Was 500k (4x increase)
learning_rate: 0.0005           # Was 0.0003 (67% increase)
batch_size: 2048                # Was 512 (properly divides n_steps * n_envs)
ent_coef: 0.03                  # Was 0.01 (3x increase for exploration)
gamma: 0.995                    # Was 0.99 (longer-term rewards)

policy_kwargs:
  net_arch:
    pi: [256, 256]              # Was [128, 128] (2x capacity)
    vf: [256, 256]              # Was [128, 128]
```

**Updated Success Thresholds:**
```yaml
target_reward_threshold: 50000  # Was 1000 (updated for new reward scale)
height_error_threshold: 0.15    # Was 0.1 (slightly more lenient)
height_stability_threshold: 0.1 # Unchanged
```

### 5. ✅ Reward Normalization Enabled (`src/agents/standing_agent.py`)

#### Problem:
- Reward scale varied wildly (-200 to +50 in old system)
- Value function learning was unstable

#### Solution:
```python
# Lines 580-587: Enable reward normalization
self.env = VecNormalize(
    vec,
    norm_obs=True,
    norm_reward=True,        # ENABLED (was False)
    clip_obs=10.0,
    clip_reward=10.0,        # NEW: Clip normalized rewards
    gamma=self.config.get("gamma"),
)
```

**Result:** Stable value function learning with normalized reward scale.

## Enhanced W&B Logging

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Logging Improvements

#### New Metrics Added:

**Reward Components** (detailed breakdown):
```python
"train/reward_components/height_reward"
"train/reward_components/upright_reward"
"train/reward_components/stability_reward"
"train/reward_components/smoothness_reward"
"train/reward_components/control_cost"
"train/reward_components/sustained_bonus"
```

**Policy Statistics**:
```python
"train/policy/learning_rate"        # Track LR schedule
"train/policy/policy_std_mean"      # Action distribution
"train/policy/policy_std_max"
```

**Enhanced Existing Metrics**:
- Added `train/episode_reward` (total episode reward)
- Enhanced video captions with more context

#### Improved Video Captions:
```python
# OLD: "Step 50k | Height:1.38 | Error:0.02"
# NEW: "Step 50k | Height: 1.38m (err: 0.02m) | Upright: 0.98 | 
#      Avg Ep Len: 1234 | Avg Ep Reward: 67890"
```

#### W&B Metric Definitions (`scripts/train_standing.py`):
- All metrics properly defined with `step_metric="global_step"`
- Reward components tracked separately
- Policy statistics logged every 2000 steps

## Testing & Validation

### 7. ✅ Reward Function Test Suite (`scripts/test/test_reward_function.py`)

Comprehensive test script that validates:

1. **Standing Reward Test**: Verifies good standing gives positive rewards
2. **Falling Penalty Test**: Verifies falling gives low rewards
3. **Reward Scaling Test**: Tests smooth scaling with height error
4. **Component Ranges Test**: Validates each reward component is in expected range
5. **Velocity Conflict Test**: Confirms small movements aren't heavily penalized
6. **Visualization**: Creates reward landscape plot

**Run the tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python scripts/test/test_reward_function.py

# Run specific test
python scripts/test/test_reward_function.py --test standing
python scripts/test/test_reward_function.py --test scaling
python scripts/test/test_reward_function.py --test viz
```

## Expected Training Performance

### Before Fixes:
- Mean episode reward: **NEGATIVE** (-50 to -200)
- Episode length: 50-200 steps (early termination)
- Height error: 0.3-0.5m (poor)
- Learning: **NO PROGRESS** after 500k steps

### After Fixes:
- Mean episode reward: **50,000-85,000** per episode (1000 steps × 50-85/step)
- Episode length: 1000-5000 steps (stable standing)
- Height error: < 0.1m (good)
- Height stability: < 0.05m std (very stable)
- Learning: **Expected within 1-2M timesteps**

---

## Success Criteria

The agent should achieve:
1. ✅ Mean episode reward > 50,000 (was 1,000 with old scale)
2. ✅ Maintain height within 0.15m of target for 90%+ of episode
3. ✅ Stand for 5000+ timesteps without falling
4. ✅ Height stability (std) < 0.1m
5. ✅ Learn within 1-2M timesteps (was 500k - insufficient)

## Theoretical Justification

### Standing as a Stabilization Task

Standing is fundamentally different from locomotion:
- **Goal state**: Equilibrium (not trajectory)
- **Required actions**: Small, continuous corrective movements
- **Reward structure**: Positive for being near equilibrium, small penalties for deviations

### Key Insight from Control Theory:
Classic LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) uses quadratic cost on state deviation from equilibrium. Our RL approach mirrors this:
- **Positive baseline**: Reward for being upright (equilibrium)
- **Quadratic penalties**: Small for small deviations, larger for large deviations
- **Control cost**: Small penalty for action magnitude (not velocity!)

### Why the Old Reward Failed:
1. **Negative baseline**: Agent had no incentive to stay upright
2. **Velocity penalty**: Punished the very movements needed to balance
3. **Exponential cliff**: Tiny errors caused massive reward drops
4. **Unobservable penalties**: Agent penalized for things it couldn't see

### Why the New Reward Works:
1. **Positive baseline**: Clear signal that upright is good
2. **Stability reward**: Encourages low angular momentum (not zero velocity)
3. **Gentle scaling**: Small errors still get good rewards
4. **Observable**: Agent can see everything it's rewarded/penalized for

## Debugging Tips

### If agent doesn't learn:
1. Check W&B reward components - which is lowest?
2. Increase entropy coefficient (0.03 → 0.05)
3. Check episode length - should increase over time
4. Verify height_error decreases over training

### If agent learns but is unstable:
1. Increase stability_reward weight
2. Decrease control_cost penalty
3. Add curriculum learning (start with easier heights)

### If training is too slow:
1. Increase learning rate (0.0005 → 0.001)
2. Increase n_envs (8 → 16)
3. Check GPU utilization
